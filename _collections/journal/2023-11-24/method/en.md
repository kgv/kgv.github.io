## Rectives

- 10% silver nitrate
- hexane-diethyl ether (80:20, v/v)
- diethyl ether
- 0.1% (w/v) 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein in 95% methanol,
- solution of 0.1% (w/v) 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein in 95% methanol

## Laboratory protocol

1) Bands are scraped from the plate into test tubes;
2) Solution of the internal standard, for example methyl heptadecanoate in methanol solution (1 mL);
3) Add hexane-diethyl ether (1:1, v/v; 3.5 mL);
4) Add 20% aqueous sodium chloride (1 mL);
5) The contents are mixed thoroughly by shaking and using a vortex mixer;
6) Centrifuged briefly to precipitate the solids;
7) The top layer is pipetted off;
8) Aqueous layer is washed twice more with similar volumes of hexane-ether;
9) The combined extracts are washed with 0.05 M Tris buffer (pH 9.0; 2 mL);
10) Dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate.
